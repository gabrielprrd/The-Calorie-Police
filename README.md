The Calorie Police is a React App that calculates an user's daily caloric need and find diets using the Spoonacular API.

## Technologies:
  - React and Styled-Components

## Installation
To run locally on development mode, simply clone this repo and then:

This project is currently under development. I'm creating a backend with Node.js and Express in order to change some implementations.

**Keep coding!**
