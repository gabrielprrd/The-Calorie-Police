What is my daily calorie intake, and how many calories do I actually need per day? These are questions anyone who has ever been concerned with their health or weight has asked many times before. And the answer? Well, when it comes to your wellbeing, it\\u2019s vital! If you\\u2019re consuming more calories than you need per day, you\\u2019re bound to keep piling on the pounds year after year. This can lead to being overweight, developing cardiovascular disease, and even becoming obese. On the other hand, consuming to few calories can be just as dangerous.

Simply fill in the required information, and, whether you\\u2019re looking to lose weight or gain weight, our daily calorie intake calculator will put you on the right path! How our Calorie Intake Calculator works So, how exactly does our calculator find your daily calorie needs? Your recommended calorie intake depends on several different factors, including gender, age and daily activity. Our caloric needs calculator takes all of these variables into account. Gender, for example, plays an essential role in daily calorie intake calculation. Men generally have a higher muscle percentage than women. Since muscle burns calories faster than fat, the calorie requirements for men will be naturally higher than the calorie intake needs for women. Age also plays an essential role. As our bodies age, they burn fewer and fewer calories per day. That means, as an individual ages and their metabolism slows, their daily caloric needs decrease as well. This is an essential factor, especially if someone fails to reduce their calorie intake from year to year. Weight gain is generally the result. Lastly, but most certainly not least, is the factor of lifestyle and activity. Those with a physically active lifestyle will burn more calories during the day and will have higher calorie requirements. Furthermore, individuals participating in sports, and building more muscles as a result, will have a higher recommended calorie intake.\"), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 25\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Daily calorie needs based on current weight If you\\u2019re looking to adjust your calorie intake in order to lose weight, to gain weight, or even maintain your weight, adapting your calorie consumption based on your size is essential. As would be expected, someone with a below average height is going to require a much lower calorie intake than someone of above average height. This is why we generally see men with higher daily caloric needs than women, as they tend to have much larger statures. Heavier people utilize more energy daily, and in turn require an increased caloric intake. Our caloric needs calculator takes this into account by requesting your current body weight. It\\u2019s also important to keep in mind that understanding and utilizing a calorie needs calculator and its suggested calorie intake is a process. If you\\u2019re looking to adjust calorie intake for weight loss, it must be done in a consistent and healthy manner. Dramatically dropping calorie intake or reverting to previous unhealthy eating habits will lead to a \\u201Cyo-yo effect,\\u201D where you can easily gain back what you\\u2019ve lost, and put on even more weight than you started with.

Daily activity therefore becomes an essential element for our calorie needs calculator. Daily calorie intake for extremely active daily routing, like that of a construction worker, teacher or waiter, for example, should be much higher than that of an office worker, or someone with a less active lifestyle.
